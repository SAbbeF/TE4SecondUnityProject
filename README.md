# TE4 Second Unity Project
This is a 8 persons collaborated project making a LAN-based multiplayer first person PvPvE.

What is this game and how it works?

This is a multiplayer first person PvPvE. The game is melee based and only traps have projectiles. The PvP aspect couldn't reach its goal because of deadline but PvE is fully functional. Muliplayer is based on LAN connection therefore you can only play with decives connected to same internet source. You also need to build the game for other client as well as checking your ip address manually.

How to check my current ip address?

You can launch one of your installed CMD (Command Prompt) or search `CMD` in search bar to open the pre installed windows version. After opening it type `ipconfig`. Under your LAN connection, Wi-Fi or wire, you see your IPv4 or IPv6 address. Copy the IP address and use it as connection to host player.

What have I done as a person?

I was the team leader in the second half of project and was the person controlling and pushing different branches and parts. Beside being in charge of project I was 
- The network developer 
- Level maker and designer (traps and enemies excluded)
- Made the playeable character (first person camera, player movement as well as setting up animations for player actions)
- I also co-worked on player attack animations, traps functionality och positioning, Enemy behavior and animation.
